## 👋 About Me

<p align="left">
I am an <b>AI Research–oriented IT student</b> with a strong foundation in <b>mathematics, machine learning, and deep learning</b>.
My current focus is on <b>computer vision</b>, especially change detection, representation learning, and Transformer-based architectures.
I value <b>rigorous experimentation</b>, clean baselines, and data-centric research practices.
</p>

* 🎓 IT student, working toward graduation while building a solid research profile
* 🔬 AI researcher-in-training (CV / Deep Learning / Transformers)
* 📊 Interested in experimental design, evaluation metrics, and reproducibility
* 🧠 Learning mindset: theory first → implementation → analysis
* 🐛 Debugging models by night, reading papers by day
